## Minor Project

### Machine Learning Pipeline on Cloud

The aim of this project is to create a Machine Learning Model and host it on a Cloud Application and create a Web Application for accessing it through internet. <br>
We will be using a simple dataset of used vehicles for our model and try to predict the price of a vehicle depending on user specified features. <br>
